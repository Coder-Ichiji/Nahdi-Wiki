* Inrtoduction
  This tutorial is about how shortcut time to connect Bluetooth devices such as Speakers, Transmitters and any other electronic devices from terminal.
  In this guide, we will use BlueZ which provide support for the core Bluetooth layers and protocols.

* The Feature of BluZ
  - Complete modulat implementation.
  - Symmetric multi processing safe.
  - Multithreaded data processing.
  - Support for multiple Bluetooth devices.
  - Real hardware abstraction.
  - Standard socket interface to all layers.
  - Device and service level security support.
* Installation

** How install BlueZ?
  Install *BlueZ* package by using package manager

  #+begin_src bash
  sudo xbps-install
  #+end_src
** Add GID to USER
  the package provide element called *bluetoothctl* utility. You need to add your account to the id group:

  #+begin_src bash
  sudo usermod -aG lp `whoami`
  #+end_src

* Enable Bluetooth device
  The enable services is depending on your init system.

** Enable Bluetooth with SystemD
   you can enable the services by SystemD usint the command:

   #+begin_src bash
   systemctl is-enabled bluetooth.service
   #+end_src

   the resualt of this you will find one word is *enabled*.

   Other wise you can check about status by running the command line:

   #+begin_src bash
   systemctl status bluetooth.service
   #+end_src

   the result is like:

** Enable Bluz with Runit

* Pair and Connect to a Bluetooth device
  We are going to use the /bluetoothctl/ CLI. If you have an alternative front-end tool such as Gnome Bluetooth, you can use it instead.

** Ensure Bluetooth Device is not disabled.
   Checking about wireless and bluetooth enable device is by command /rfkill/:

   #+begin_src bash
   rfkill
   #+end_src

   the output will show like this:

   |------------------------------------------------------|
   | ID TYPE      DEVICE                   SOFT      HARD |
   | 0 bluetooth tpacpi_bluetooth_sw   blocked unblocked  |
   | 2 wlan      phy0                unblocked unblocked  |
   |------------------------------------------------------|

   If it is blocked like the example above please run command below:

   #+begin_src bash
   sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
   #+end_src

   Confirm it is unblocked using /rfkill/.

   |------------------------------------------------------|
   | ID TYPE      DEVICE                   SOFT      HARD |
   | 0 bluetooth tpacpi_bluetooth_sw unblocked unblocked  |
   | 2 wlan      phy0                unblocked unblocked  |
   | 4 bluetooth hci0                unblocked unblocked  |
   |------------------------------------------------------|

** Steps to connect device:
   This is a general outline of pairing a device using /bluetoothctl/

*** Start the /bluetoothctl/ interactive command.

     #+begin_src bash
     bluetoothctl
     #+end_src

     the message will show /Agent registered/.

     Then run /show/ to see device details. You will see the UUID for devices.

     #+begin_src bash
     bluetoothctl show
     #+end_src
*** Turn On your Bluetooth Adapter
    Turning Adapter is by running these command by bluetooth mode:

    #+begin_src bash
    [bluetooth]# agent KeyboardOnly
    ;; Agent is already registerd
    [bluetooth]# default-agent
    ;; Default agent request successful
    [bluetooth]# power on
    ;; Changing power on succeeded
    #+end_src

*** Scanning and Pairing Steps
    Do a scan to detect your Bluetooth devices

    #+begin_src bash
    [bluetooth]# scan on
    #+end_src

    the result for example is like:
