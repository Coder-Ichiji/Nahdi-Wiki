* Introduction
/Doom Emacs/ is GNU Emacs with spicial configuration that make Emacs fast, good looking, and easy to customize. /Doom/ has build with Evil Mode (*VI* and *VIM*) that easy for VIM Users.

Emacs support Emacs 25.1 or higher and created by Henrik Lissner.

* Installing Doom Emacs
To get /Doom Emacs/ must have Emacs. Most distrbution in GNU Linux have Emacs in them repository. In Void Linux installing such as following:

#+begin_example bash
sudo xbps-install emacs-gtk3
#+end_example

*Note*: There are defferent between emacs, emacs-gtk2, and emacs-gtk3.
| package    | Description                                       |
|------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| emacs      | Pure Emacs that only worked into terminal         |
| emacs-gtk2 | Emacs that worked into frame build in GTK+2.      |
| emacs-gtk3 | Emacs that worked also into frame build in GTK+3. |

Then you need some packages to start using emacs. This package is depincy for /Doom Emacs/ and all you need  (git, ripgrep, fd)

| Package | Description                                        |
|---------+----------------------------------------------------|
| git     | Git Tree Histroy Storage Tool                      |
| ripgrep | Fast Search Tool Inspired By ag and grep           |
| fd      | Simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find |

#+begin_example bash
sudo xbps-install git ripgrep fd
#+end_example

Finally cloan /Doom Emacs/ from Henrik Lissner [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][repository]] by following command:

#+begin_example bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+end_example

then install it by command:

#+begin_example bash
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+end_example

* Configuration Files
You will find configuration files on directory ~/doom.d/ and it is just three files:

** init.el
This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after mdifying this file.
** config.el
Place your private configuration here. Remember, you do not need to run 'doom sync' after modifying this file.
** package.el
To install a package with /Doom Emacs/ you must declate them here and run 'doom sync' on the command line. then restart emacs for the changes to take effect.
