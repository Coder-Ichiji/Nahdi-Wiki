* Introduction
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.
