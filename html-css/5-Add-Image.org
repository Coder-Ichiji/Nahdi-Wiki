* What do you need in tag <img>
In /img/ you need the source attribute. Other thing, you need customize the size of the image if you want.

* Usage
all you need write inside tag is source with extention of image "foo.jpg". if the file was on other directory we but it like "directory/foo.jpg"

#+begin_example html

<body>
...
<img src="foo.jpg">
...
</body>

#+end_example

To customize the size is by using attribute (width and height). the value is by pixel as default.


#+begin_example html

<body>
...
<img src="foo.jpg" width="70" height="10">
...
</body>

#+end_example

*Note* if you put only width without height (or oppsite) the scales change automactily.
