* The Definition
  *Programming* is a process to solve problem.

* Programming Life Cycle
  *Programming Life Cycle* is steps write program and executed to solve the problems.

** Step One: Analyze The Problem.

*** Understand Overall The Problem.
The understanding of problem comes while write all things need in programs with its chartflow for process.

*** Define Problem's Requirments.
After understanding the problem and drow the chartflow you will should consider the below:

**** Does program require user interaction.
Sometimes the programs run backgound, system action, or needing user interaction.
***** if yes, what is input?
    Must programmer consider what input shuld enter in the code.
**** What is the expected output?

     input --> Process --> output

=Algorithem= is step-by-step programming solving.

** Step Two: Implement Algorithem

*** Implement The Algorithem.
    
**** Implement The Algorithem in Code.
**** Verfiy That Algorithem is work.

** Step Three: Maintenace
/Use/ and /Modify/ the program if the problem domain changes. If the problem is complex, divide it into sub-problems.
dividing will be by analyze each sub-problem as above.
