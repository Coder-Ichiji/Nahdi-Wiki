* Introduction
You can access to *Routing Table* by using command ~show ip route~ in PuTTy or Telnet.

** Routing Table Types
   /there are diffrent ways to setup routing and this is some of set routing./
*** Dynamic Routing
*Dynamic Routing* is using protocol called *Dynamic Protocols* and these protocols by to types, depending in /speeds/ and /space/.
These sections are *Link Status Protocols* and *Distance Vector*.
**** Link Status
The *Link Status Protocols* that depends on speed, not space. the Link Status Protocols for example: OSPF and EIGRP.
***** OSPF

***** EIGRP

**** Distance Vector
The *Distance Vector* is depends on space, not speed. The Distance Vector use protocols like: IGRP and RIP.
***** IGRP

***** RIP

**** Expalain:
|           | Distance | Vector Routing Protocols | Link State Routing Protocols | Path Vector    |
|-----------+----------+--------------------------+------------------------------+----------------|
| Classful  | RIP      | IGRP                     |                              | EGP            |
| Classless | RIPv2    | EIGRP                    | OSPFv2   IS-IS               | BGPv4          |
| IPv6      | RIPng    | EIGRP for IPv6           | OSPFv3   IS-IS for IPv6      | BGPv4 for IPv6 |
|-----------+----------+--------------------------+------------------------------+----------------|

*** Default Routing

*** Static Routing
*Static Routing* show the connection that made by Network Engineer via commands in router.
In Routing Tables will point this type by *S* charecter, shortcut of *Static*. and Jump will mentioned as setup that made.

*** Direct Connection
This connection mean Network has been links to router without protocol.
*Direct Connection* mentioned in Routing Table by *C* Charecter and no jumps value, so, you will see (0).
